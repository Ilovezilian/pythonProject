## back ground
  this is my third time to think about where to write my note?
  I was write my note to note software like youdao note, oneNote. but It's not portable enough; So write note in jianshu.com who has app and web page and support markdown grammar, has black theme. To be honest, jianshu is very nice to a writer.
  However I was a programmer, I think a way to to manage my note just like my projects code managed by version control tools git. I saw recently some article perfect on github.com. And then build this.

## purpose
1. record my notes 
2. collect some wonderful source, include: tool, article, insteresting things, and so on.
