# table size
```sql 
--数据库中单个表的大小（不包含索引）
select pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size('表名'));

--查出所有表（包含索引）并排序
SELECT table_schema || '.' || table_name AS table_full_name, pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('"' || table_schema || '"."' || table_name || '"')) AS size
FROM information_schema.tables
ORDER BY

--查出表大小按大小排序并分离data与index
